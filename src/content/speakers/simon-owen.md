Simon kicked off the meetup with an interactive session on **Building a Centre for Enablement with Copilot Studio**.

Drawing on real-world experience, Simon explored how organisations can move beyond experimentation and embed Copilot Studio into meaningful, scalable enablement strategies. Practical, hands-on, and quietly visionary.
