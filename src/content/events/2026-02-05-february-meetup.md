## About This Event

Join us at **Townshend House** for our February meetup, an evening of practical learning, community stories, and proper tech conversations – plus free pizza, obviously 🍕

This month we’re covering everything from **Agentic AI** and what it actually means in practice, through to **building meaningful tech communities in higher education**, and a **hands-on look at SQL Server working alongside Power Apps**. Whether you’re deep in the Power Platform already or just getting started, you’ll walk away with ideas you can use the next day.
